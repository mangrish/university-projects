433-255 How to use lp_shell
---------------------------


1. At the unix prompt type:

   lp_shell



2. This will start SWI-prolog with the lp_shell environment. You will see the
   SWI prompt which looks like:

      ?-



3. At the SWI prompt type:

      go.



4. You will see the following text:

      =======================
      LOGIC PROGRAMMING SHELL
      =======================

      1. Begin logged session
      2. Begin unlogged session 

      Enter choice:


   lp_shell can keep a log file (in the current directory) of your session
   with the shell. The log file will basically contain the text that you
   see each time you type a query. This may be useful if you want to 
   look over the results of your queries at a later time.

   If you want a log file type:

      1.

   If you don't want a log file type:

      2. 



5. You will then see the lp_shell prompt:

      >> Next command ('h' for help) ? 




6. You should load and compile the prolog program that you are interested in.
   For example if your program was called foo.pl type:

      [foo].




7. lp_shell will print a short message and then provide you with the
   same prompt as in step 5. You may begin to enter queries at this point.
   After each query you make there will be a trace of the resolution steps that
   were made by lp_shell. Note that lp_shell does not perform backtracking.




8. To quit lp_shell type:
   
      q.

   This will return you to the SWI-prolog prompt. To quit SWI-prolog type:

      halt.

   or

      control-d


NOTES:

   lp_shell is not very robust. If you type a command wrong it may exit
   and return you to the SWI prompt. So be very careful with what you type.

   Make sure you always end each command or query with a full-stop.

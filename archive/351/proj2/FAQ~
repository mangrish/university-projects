Q: Should we do the searching for owners in SQL or dump the data into
   a data structure and do it in C.

A: If you think about the potential number of database accesses you might
   have to make by searching for each owner in each chain using SQL,
   you will see that it is more efficient in terms of disk accesses to
   put all the data in a data structure and process it in an 
   in-memory data structure.

   While in this case you will need to dump the whole table, so it
   may seem like you are throwing away all the potential of relational
   database searching, in most real-world situations the select statement
   would include a condition that leads it to capture only a small
   fraction of the data, which would then be searched in-memory;
   in this situation the time savings is even more significant.

Q: How long should we make character strings which access the database?

A: You may make them the length of the string as defined in the
   database schema plus 1 (to account for the null character), just 
   as account.sc has done, or use a length of 30 for them (which 
   includes the null character).

Q: The specification says that hotels can only have one owner.  Can other
   companies have more than one owner?

A: No, to simplify the programming you can assume that each company only
   has one owner.

Q: Do we have to check whether cycles exist in the ownership, e.g. company
   A owns part of company B, and company B owns part of company A?

A: No, there is no need to check for cycles.   You can assume that there 
   are no cycles in the data.

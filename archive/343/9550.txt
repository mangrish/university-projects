*** MARK ANGRISH (74592) ***

No of essay being reviewed: 9550.ps
===============================================
Overall impression: At times seems a little rushed....otherwise strong structure
									  has more potential than what was handed in... 


Content: Content is very good, explains everything in detail, yet without
				 overflowing with information, and also contention is backed up well.




Organisation of material:extremely well structured piece, listing risks and
												 strategies for each topic...flow after this changes.
												 with direct shift into technologies..without any lead
												 in or much content..


Presentation of references: is well done, although a bit lacking at times..
														maybe more in depth research into technologies was
														required



Clarity of writing style: selction of words is poor at times, and also the 
													grammer has a little more to be desired..



Strengths: the structure and for the most part the flow of the piece is good..
					 conclusion and introduction are also well done



Weaknesses: grammer is a let down...as is the description of the technolgies.
i						more references for some of the arguements would be good




Suggestions for revision: another abstract??? more drafting to fix grammer..
													fix problem of flow ffrom risks to technolgies..

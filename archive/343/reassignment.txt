\begin{abstract}

The internet and E-commerce is revolutionising the way companies and consumers interact,
contradicting the precedents set by traditional business.  With astronomical increases
in sales figures in the last three years, e-commerce is fast becoming one of the most
viable means to promote and conduct business.  However, a recent spate of security breaches
has highlighted the risks consumers face when shopping online.  Events like these
have raised a plethora of issues surrounding security.  New strategies and
technologies are being introduced to combat the problems of cybercrime, and minimise its
affect on the e-commerce industry.



\end{abstract}

\newpage

Australia is rapidly emerging as a major player in the e-commerce industry.
Out of all the developed countries in the world, Australia is 6th in the world in
computers per capita, and 7th in the world in both connections to the internet
and new information tecnology\cite{WCY:wcy99}.  By 1988 there were 2million Internet households in Australia and by 2002 it is estimated that
5.8 million of us will be online.  In three years' time, the country is expected to be generating
\$6.7billion in e-commerce\cite{Horadam:Age99}.
Even so, it only represents a small percentage of the total number of purchases in 
the e-commerce market.
So what is holding the Australian consumer back from using e-commerce to purchase goods?
It simply comes down to \textit{trust}.

Up to 50\% of on-line Australians are not using e-commerce to purchase goods as they simply 
\textit{do not trust} it with their intimate details\cite{anon:ABF00}.  This is a well justified stance since the
recent shutdowns of Yahoo.com, eBay and other leading websites in February, which have boosted public
awareness of the need to address cybercrime. Also,  Australians are different from people in other countries such as the US in that
they are more concerned with security than with the actual prices e-commerce
offers\cite{anon:ABF00}.



Therefore, to fully realise the benefits of e-commerce, it is imperitive that organisations put in place
security solutions that offer the same level of trust and confidentiality as signed, legal documents and 
contracts, and that customers are confident in the level of security offered.  E-commerce in any business
requires strong security measures, that provide water-tight confidentiality , authentication, access control
data integrity and accountablitity.

We aim to show that the current technology and emerging ones -- specifically SET
-- go a long way in addressing the need for secure online transactions.

\section{What are the risks of e-commerce?}

 E-commerce, by its very nature, is a risky business.  To conduct a transaction online
 you have to send private, and potentially damaging, information over an unsecure
 network.  A person with the right tools and a malicious intent can intercept any
 data as it travels over the internet, exposing companies to major liabilities.  

 Compared to 'normal' crime, it is easier for the hacker to get away with their crime.
 Lack of collateral evidence means that common methods for catching most criminals is 
 reduntant as no fingerprints or eyewitnesses etc. can be traced\cite{Phillips:Age99}.

 According to the Computer Security Institute, financial losses attributed to computer
 crime in the United States have doubled in the past year, to an estimated
 \$16.5 billion \cite{anonLA:Age00}.  This is mainly attributable to financial
 fraud and theft of proprietary information.  CSI also found that 59\% of companies
 they surveyed said they had experienced attacks initiated from the internet, compared
 to 38\% from computers within their organisation\cite{anonLA:Age00}.
 
 The theft of valuable information is a major risk.  Hackers have developed sophisticated 
 software that constantly checks different sites for weak points by which they can
 gain entry.  If they find a system that they can enter, they can take information
 that is valuable to the company.  They could then sell it to an unscrupulous rival,
 or try to extort the company.

 A hacker could also try to damage a company by altering or crashing their website.
 By altering the site to provide false information, or making the site unavailable to
 customers, the hackers damage the company's reputation.

 Consumers have low confidence in the security of the internet, particularly in relation
 to sending credit card details to conduct a transaction (which many outlets currently
 implement).  Consumers are understandably worried about using their credit cards online,
 partly because it isnt clear what woiuld happen if fraud occurs\cite{Sinclair:Age00}.
 In Europe alone, credit card fraud cost Visa banks \pounds 150 million last
 year, and in the US, a 43\% rise in online crime was reported \cite{August:Comp00}.
 It is because of this large amount of cybercrime that consumers are put off.
 Up to 50\% of Australian consumers say that their major concern with online shopping
 is the security of credit card information \cite{anon:ABF00}.  
 
 The risk involved with credit card fraud on the internet, though, is greater for
 the seller than it would otherwise be.  This is because they are forced to wear
 the cost of the fraud.  That is, when someone fraodulently uses anothers' 
 credit card details to buy online, and then taht person disputes the fact that
 they made the purchase, then vendor must pay up, leaving them out of pocket.  
 The only way they can re-coup costs is if the offender is caught.  It is this fact
 which makes it dangerous to trade online, especially for small business, where 
 such fraud could even force them out of business.

 The risk to the consumer has lowered, however, with Visa in the US announcing that
 consumers will have no liability if their card is stolen online\cite{Sinclair:Age00}.
  



\section{What strategies are in place to fight cybercrime?}

Security is the backbone of e-commerce because the critical issue is establishing trust between
parties, says Tom Shuster, RSA Security seniorVicepresident. Security should be the major IT
issue for companies in e-business if research on the rapid increase in cybercrime is to be 
heeded\cite{Whitby:Bwire00}. 
Basically , to do this,five security principles can be applies to e-commerce transactions, although each focus on securing a 
distinct aspect of a transaction, all five must work together to provide a truly secure e-commerce application.

Authentication ensures both parties are who they say they are.  Forms of authentication inlclude smartcards,
digital certificates and perhaps eventually biometrics.

Privacy protects confidential information using various forms of cryptography. Cryptograpy is a way of
scrambling data so that it can't be read by an unauthorised party.  Privacy in e-commerce transactions
must be a two way street.  Customers on one hand want to protect purchasing information, account information,
credit card numbers etc.  Financial institutions on the other hand will want to protect internal information.
At the moment, the RSA algorithm, is the most accepted way to encrypt data.

Authorisation ensures that each party is allowed to enter the commitment.

Integrity ensures that a transaction  has not been altered or destroyed while the communication is in transit.

And finally, non-repudiation, provides evidence for both parties that the transition actually occured.
In essence, it provides an electronic receipt of the transaction\cite{anon:ABF00}.

There are also organisations involved in fighting crime online.  CERT (originally Computer Emergency Response
Team) in the UK is a centre dedicated to the research and development of new ways to tackle internet crime\cite{August:Comp00}.

Here in Australia, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has the job of
ensuring consumer confidence, commercial certainty, efficiency and market integrity across all
mediums, including the internet.  In this role, they are developing a range of countermeasures that
may help deal with the challenges of the internet.  Recently ASIC created an Electronic Enforcement
Unit to extend its internet enforcement work.  This unit released the Electronic Funds Transfer Code
of Conduct and is working with industry and government to review and broaden the EFT code to cover
all financial electronic transactions.  ASIC is actively pushing for greater coordination and 
cooperation of regulatory bodies, both internationally and domestically\cite{Phillips:Age99}. 

English Home Secretary Jack Straw has fulfilled his promise to set up a
cybercrime unit, announcing that he was giving the National Criminal
Intelligence Service \pounds 337,000 to draw up a detailed plan for a
high-tech crime squad\cite{anon2:Comp00}.




\section{What technologies are available to combat cybercrime?}


Ever since version 2.0 of both Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, transactions have been 
encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer(SSL), a protocol that creates a secure connection to the server, protecting
the data as it travels over the internet.  SSL uses public key encryption, one of the stronger encryption methods
around.


However, an emerging technology being used to provide secure financial transactions on
the internet is Secure Electronic Transaction (SET).  SET is quickly emerging as an industry standard, as it encodes
the credit card
numbers that sit on vendors' servers so that only banks and credit card companies can read the 
numbers\cite{Clarke:url99}.

SET is a system for ensuring the security of financial transactions on the Internet. It was 
supported initially by Mastercard, Visa, Microsoft, Netscape, and is now being incorporated into
other companies, most recently that being American Express\cite{Clarke:url99}.
As Mastercard( which own 25\% of the market) and Visa(50\%), have large influence in payment mechanisms,
there is a greater dedication to the effienct running of the SET protocol\cite{Clarke:url99}.

With SET, a user is given
a digital certificate. 
A digital certificate is like an electronic ``credit card'' that establishes
your credentials when doing business or other transactions on the Web, and contains certain encoded information
about a consumer or a merchant.
--a good analogy of it is a passport.

With the digital certificate,  a transaction is conducted,
and verified using a combination of digital certificates and digital
signatures among the purchaser, a merchant, and the purchaser's bank in a way that
ensures privacy and confidentiality.

A digital signature is an electronic rather than a written signature that can be used by someone to
authenticate the identity of the sender of a message or of the signer of a document. 

SET makes use of Netscape's Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL), Microsoft's Secure Transaction Technology (STT), and
Terisa System's Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (S-HTTP). SET uses some
but not all aspects of a public key infrastructure (PKI).  That is, as long as the
consumer uses one of these browswers, they can take adavtage of the safest and
best technology around for securing transactions without worrying about security
breaches.

To understand how SET works, a couple of underlying technologies need to be explained
first.
The primary principles of SET is the way it manipulates to data using cryptology.
SET uses the Public key encrytion algorithm to encrypt and decrypt data. 


	In public key cryptography, a public and private \emph{key} are created
simultaneously using the same algorithm (a popular one is known as RSA, researced and developed by the company with
the same name--RSA Security)
by a certificate authority (CA)\cite{Horadam:Age99}.
The private key is given only to the
requesting party and the public key is made publicly available (as part of
a digital certificate) in a directory that all parties can access.  The
private key is never shared with anyone or sent across the Internet.  You
use the private key to decrypt text that has been encrypted with your public
key by someone else (who can find out what your public key is from a public
directory).  Thus, if I send you a message, I can find out your public key
(but not your private key) from a central administrator and encrypt a
message to you using your public key.  When you receive it, you decrypt it
with your private key.  In addition to encrypting messages (which ensures
privacy), you can authenticate yourself to me (so I know that it is really
you who sent the message
The advantage of public key encryption is that it enables users of the Internet to securely and privately exchange
data and money through the use of a public and a private cryptographic key
pair that is obtained and shared through a trusted authority.

In cryptography, a key is a variable value(ie password passphrase etc.) that is applied using an algorithm 
to a string or block 
of unencrypted text to produce encrypted text. The
length of the key generally determines how difficult it will be to decrypt the text in a given message.

A CA (certificate authority) is an authority in a network that issues and manages security credentials and public 
keys for message encryption and
verify information provided by the
certificate. 

SET has been designed with credit-card transactions in mind, and does not support transmission of PINs.
The early versions of SET can therefore not be used to
support debit-card transactions (at least in countries like Australia for which PIN protection is obligatory).
On the other hand, SET transactions are potentially
more secure than PIN-based transactions, and SET could in due course become accepted as a means of conducting
payments against a revolving line of credit,
or the card-holder's own funds.

The scheme uses accepted technologies (including public-key encryption, digital signatures, and certificates) and established protocols (including the secure
hashing algorithm -  RSA's asymmetric encryption algorithm etc.).

It promises secure transmission, and a considerable level of confidence that the participants have the authority to undertake the transaction.


But there are few guarantees.  The security of many systems depends on unproven (but believeable)
assumptions.  The size of the RSA public key needed to underpin user confidence grows with each 
improvement in the theoretical attacks on computer power\cite{Horadam:Age99}.

The scheme is complex, and depends on many participants conforming with the specification, and also
contains nothing that manages participants' private keys. It appears that these will need to be stored on 
participants' workstations and servers, or
additional peripherals installed on workstations and servers to handle a secure token (probably a chip-card).

The scheme says nothing about the apportionment of responsibility for losses. A great deal of this 
is already addressed
in the existing systems. However the
payment-processing organisations and banks may seek to make card-holders responsible for transactions undertaken
using the card-holder's private key. Given
that no workable solution exists whereby card-holders can secure their private keys, consumers would be at risk of 
someone breaking into their premises, or
taking control of their workstation from a remote site, and spending the card-holder's money without their knowledge, 
and without recourse.



Other known protocols being developed are the 
IPSec (Internet Protocol Security protocol), and the virtual private network (VPN). 

IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) is a developing standard for security
at the network level of communication.
Earlier security approaches have inserted security at the application
layer of the communications model. IPSec will be especially useful for
implementing virtual private networks and for remote user access through
dial-up connection to private networks. A big advantage of IPSec is that
security arrangements can be handled without requiring changes to
individual user computers. Cisco has been a leader in proposing IPSec
as a standard (or combination of standards and technologies) and has
included support for it in its network routers. 


A virtual private network (VPN) is a private data network that makes use
of the public telecommunication infrastructure, maintaining privacy
through the use of a tunneling protocol and security procedures.
A virtual private network can be contrasted with a system of owned or
leased lines that can only be used by one company. The idea of the VPN
is to give the company the same capabilities at much lower cost by using
the shared public infrastructure rather than a private one. Phone
companies have provided secure shared resources for voice messages.
A virtual private network makes it possible to have the same secure
sharing of public resources for data.  Companies today are looking at
using a private virtual network for both extranets and wide-area intranets. 

Using a virtual private network involves encrypting data before sending
it through the public network and decrypting it at the receiving end.
An additional level of security involves encrypting not only the data but
also the originating and receiving network addresses.  Microsoft, 3Com,
and several other companies have developed the Point-to-Point Tunneling
Protocol (PPTP) and Microsoft has extended Windows NT to support it.
VPN software is typically installed as part of a company's firewall server.

As for other technological advances, companies such as Webtrends, develop enterprise solutions for
eBusiness Intelligence, such as their product Analyser 3.0, which provides highly scalable enterprise-class
security analysis\cite{anon:Bwire99}.



\section{Conclusion}
To realise the full potential of e-commerce, it is critical that that the emerging infrastructure support or 
uphold security principles.
To do so, business will need to implement a variety of network security functions, along with a solid security
policy.
On the technology front, there is are currently a number of solutions that are critical enablers of e-commerce
transactions, those being the implementation of the SET protocol and following the five
principles defining the strategy to combat cybercrime.
Digital certificates adress the need for authentication and authorisation, as well as privacy with the implementation
of public key cryptograghy to protect the information contained within.
These measures will encourage consumers to purchace online, with the trust and confidence of secure data transfer.

No of essay being reviewed:1006.ps
===============================================
Overall impression:very well written article which hits its audience, strong
									 arguments are backed up well(most footnotes actually should
									 be references....otherwise ok.



Content:a lot of material is presented, and presentd well, although, at times
			  it seems weak (in the arguements presented) and also a bit monotonous



Organisation of material: structure can be better, the set out of the article
													tends to make it boring....




Presentation of references: very weak, most references are from the same
														journal, thus narrowing the perspective and
														credibilty of the piece...use of footnotes actually
														should be references....it appears not much
														research was done....



Clarity of writing style: grammer is very nice, and easy to read and comprehend
													




Strengths: grammer and overall flow of article is good.  Abstract is well done,
					 conclusion is also very well done..as is the introduction, and
					 the authors contention



Weaknesses:	BIBLIOGRAPHY: very weak...most references are from the same journal
						and same volume...
						STRUCTURE: seems monotonous...
						REFERENCES: seems like more are needed to give credibility..



Suggestions for revision: reexamine the structure of the piece, and referencing
													else everything looks fine =)

Document Name:      The Software Architectural Design Document (SADD)

REVIEW SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------
Overall: FAIL
---------------

-The abstract is poorly done, and does not clearly define what this document is
about, it merely says what the project is about. Elaboration on what this 
document is about and how/why is was put together is more relevant.

-This document seems to look very much like the example SADD, accessed by the 
web on the 341 website. 

-The document seems cluttery and out of order..ie why are your use cases defined
at the very end, when they are done at the very start of OOA?

-From the layout it seems that the object oriented paradigm was followed, but
not demonstrated very well.  How did you know what to do and where? Where are
your references? How does any stakeholder in this document know what was done
here was correct?

-Did you use the checklist in the project manual at all? Or consider using the
template given?

-Where are the rest of your module/object (whatever your doing) design 
descriptions? You have some for section 2.1 but thats it.
I suggest you just have listed all the modules used in the architectural design
done, in your piece wise class diagram, then a separate section with all your
module descriptions.

-The overall module design descriptions seemed fine, so reuse them.

-Overall i think little time and effort was spent on the document, and the
research into how to synthesise it.  I suggest you spend time understanding
the OO paradigm, then reconstruct this document accordingly.  Time spent
understanding the paradigm, will help you with your document, and also create
one more relevant to your team, as opposed to the example PDD you used.
I failed you because where the content was critical, you had lack-lustre 
descriptions. The heart of the SADD is in the Design description, and this was 
not very well addressed. Also read the Project Handbook a bit more, it has a lot
of structure help, and content help, and refer to the 341 website Q and A for 
more help.

DEFINITION OF RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PASS
----
1. The review item adequately addresses all the specified criteria. 
2. Only minor modification is required to bring it up to scratch. 
3. Modifications can be dealt with internally and thus does not require further 
   review.

REWORK
------
1. The review item does not address all specified criteria. 
2. The review item requires further work meet the stated standards.
3. There is omitions or ambiguities in existing information which requires 
   restructuring. 

FAIL
----
1. The review item does not address the specified criteria. 
2. The review item requires major (re-)work and should undergo strict quality
   assurance monitoring. 
3. A Formal Re-review is recommended.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL CRITERIA - RESULTS & COMMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Legibility   PASS 

   Is the document readable? Mistake-ridden? Are pictures clear?
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   The document seemed to be quite readable, with very few spelling mistakes.
	 Flow of the document seemed quite poor in some areas. I suggest you 
	 proof read your document before you hand it up, and maybe internally review
	 it.
   There seemed no legibility mistakes and generally was of good
	 quality. Pictures were clear and easy to follow and the captions for them
	 made for good understanding of each picture.

2. Conciseness  REWORK

   Is the document direct? Too much/little detail?
   ----------------------------------------------- 
   The document has too little detail in most areas, and adequate detail in 
	 others.  The major part of the document (ie what should be called the design
   description in the templates (which are given to you for a reason!), lacked
	 the detail required to make this a quality document.

3. Coherence    FAIL

   Is the document referencing itself/other docs correctly?
   ------------------------------------------------------- 
   The referencing to the SRS is fine, but what sections of it? im sure that
	 the WHOLE srs is not relevant to a particular part of the SADD.
	 Also it seems, you have made up your own OO paradigm, so you should reference
	 where you go this from, or follow the paradigm from the suggested text for 
	 the subject or something.  Also it seems, there is a slight plagurism of
	 the example SADD given on the web.  This is a bad trap to fall into, either
	 reference that document to say that it was used as a template, or rework your
	 document to reflect what you did.  Poor thought has gone into this doc.
	 Why is it contradicting the design methodologies used etc.
	 
4. Relevance    REWORK

   Is the document addressing its stated aims? 
   -------------------------------------------
   The document has a poor aim, and therefore does not really address it.
	 On the other hand, it does have mostly correct content, and i can understand
	 what they are trying to do..Remember that this document, can be viewed by
	 and stakeholders, and should have good detail so that those ppl can 
	 understand what has been done. Mainly concentrate on your big section 
   (design description)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Section 1  FAIL
---------
1.1 Aim - More information here would be good, as in the SRS, like what was the
existing system? Elaborate more on the proposed system.

1.3 Project team - You should list who your project manager is here.

1.4 Design Process - Seems plagurised from the example give.  This is not a valid
design process.
where are your references?  How do the italicised headings related to the OO
paradigm? Show how...as Data flow diagrams do not or structure charts. Maybe
your using the wrong model? Maybe use enumerated dot points to list the 
OO paradigm (ie 1.4.1 Use cases etc). If these processes are in order they are
wrong. Why is Architectural Design in italics listed twice? This is ambiguous..
This part seems extremely poorly and lazily done.
I suggest you find a good text.. reference it, follow their process outline
and define what methodology you are really using.

1.5 Programming Environment - Define your terms in a glossary, as you are 
defining technology non explicitly (cgi-bin). What version of VB are you using?
what make of SQL are you using? What standard of HTML? are you using CSS? etc
I suggest you clearly define your technologies more.
  
Section 2    FAIL
---------
List what sections of the SRS are referred to..here im guessing your
functional requirements.

2.1  and 2.2 what about this title? relevance to architectural design..

Order of this section seems out of whack...maybe sit down and organise
the structure a bit better as the flow of the document is compromised here.

2.1.1 In the last section you said you were using OO Paradigm, and now here you
are using the structured paradigm. What the hell is going on? Do you know 
your process as taught in 341? Structured diagrams and Data flow diagrams
are not relevant to OOP.

Why are you doing the module design descriptions here? It should only be
each module used in the module design and how it relates to the 
architectural.

2.2 This layout is better... you do not need the module design descriptions 
as in the last section.

2.4 Maybe this should come under data structures? (as in the checklist of
		the project handbook).  Where are the diagrams to support how you
		derived this structure? or of the existing one. Maybe read a database
		book to see how to make tables.

Section 3    PASS
---------
This section seems well done. I would maybe put this section more to the back 
though.

Section 4     REWORK 
---------
Move this section to a more relevant position and describe the process you did
and why you went into so much detail.  Maybe demonstrate the format better. i 
got lost a fair bit.  Maybe use a user/ system notation? for ease of tracing?


Section 5    REWORK
---------

This is where your module designs should go...They get expanded upon when you 
reach detailed design. So move those module designs here.

Section 6    PASS
---------

Dont talk in a future tense. Otherwise this looks fine.

Section 7    REWORK
---------

Why are there structure diagrams and data flow diagrams here, when this is OO 
paradigm?
Figure 3-7: If any objects are reused in another diagram, make sure it has a 
triangle in the top right corner to show this. At the end of OOD you should 
have every object having either data or action attributes or both.
Maybe make separate appendix for each relevant section (ie OOA OOD, user interface etc.)


Section 8    PASS
---------

These diagrams are fine. However, detail is required to show what action is
to be performed to get to a class.

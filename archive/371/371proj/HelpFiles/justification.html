<H2>Welcome to the Justification for Tute Enrol version 1.0</H2>

<P>This document will justify why the implementation of my GUI interface
for the tute enrol program has been designed the way it has.  For ease of
understanding, the justification has been split into topics.
</P>
<P></P>

<H3>The overall design</H3>
<P>The program is setup as a wizard, where a user can select a subject offered from
a collection of subjects to enrol in. A window showing the available timeslots available
for that tute, along with the users enrolment status, and information regaurding the 
selected tute, with buttons to enrol or unenrol from a tute.  A final confirmation screen
is then brought up with a concise summary of what tute the user has enrolled in
</P>

<H3>General Features of the program</H3>
<P> The JInternalFrame has been set so the user cannot edit the size of the frame, or
maximise the frame. The user also, cannot quit from the  frame from the title bar.
This is to restrict the user in the amount of ways they can proceed through the program.
</P>
<P> The use of tooltips are used, as this is an important feature needed to aid user
interactivity, and it is also conventional.
</P>
<P>
The handling of keyboard interaction with the program is taken care of with the use of
key mnemonics, which involve the user pressing  the alt key and a character.  It is 
important to handle this case, as even though all computers have working mice, there might
be some that dont. It is therefore important to cater for as many different interaction that
users that might use to run the program. 
program.
</P>
<P>
The importance of an attractive and understandable colour scheme is extremely importannt.
This program follows a fairly conventional colour layout, with the light gray background for
JInternalFrame windows, and a light matte blue for JLabel text (which was pretty much the 
default).  Buttons are also in black text.  There is an importance in changing colours,
when important events occur( for example when a tutorial is full, or if you are enrolled 
 or not).  Important events should be bold and in either a red or green colour ( the human
eye sees these colours as more intense than blues). 
<P>
<P>Each screen has a quit button (which brings up
dialog box to warn the user they have not enrolled in the subject if they arent enrolled
in the subject), a next or back button, and a cancel button (which brings the user back
to the main menu). 
</P>

<H3>There should be no File chooser when the program is started....the selection
window in the wizard...</H3>
<P> Ideally, the tute enrol program shouldnt display the underlying data, but merely
create a graphical user interface that avoids such low level interaction with the user.
The file chooser which appears when the user opens an instance of the program is 
therefore a bad idea, as the user has to select .xml files which can be confusing, 
especially for a new student.  There is also the oversite of a user being allowed to
navigate through the chooser, and select a totally irrelevent .xml file.  Although my 
program does not overcome this problem explicitly( ie. has not removed the file chooser
from the program), it has offered a graphical easy to use interface to select a subject, 
which is meant to be a replacement interface/screen for the file chooser.
I feel this is a must of the program, as the user does not have to have any idea about
what data structures are used underneath the program, or have a potentially difficult
time understand which /.xml file to select. 
</P>

<H3>The main window in the wizard...</H3>
The GridLayout was implemented in the left pane of a JSplitPane, with
a status area in the right of the Pane. The implementation of the grid was an easy choice,
compared to presenting the user with any or JTabbedPane or even explicet referneces to 
available days available days via lists or combo boxes. The user can see in a clear, and
importantly simple way, which times on which days are available.  This is a beneficial
design for the user as they can simply look in their diary etc. to see what times are 
good for them.  The available tutorials are displayed in JComboBox's. This was 
used over the implementation of buttons, as buttons, cannot handle more than one event
occuring at the same place in a simple or program stabilising way(multiple buttons, reak
havoc on a gridLayout!). The JComboBox handles multiple events in an attractive and
importantly functional way.
</P>
<P>
When a user selects a tutorial from any of the JComboBoxes, the details are brought up
in the the Status area.  At the top is the title of the Status area, where you will notice
that if a user is enrolled, the colour of the title is green, or if the user is unenroled
the title is in red.  This simple colour schematic is designed just like a known interface,
being traffic lights. Red usually indates something is not on or in this case enrolled,
and green is used to say that the user is.  A simple gridbag layout is used with JLabels
and JTextArea's which are importantly uneditable (do not want a user making their own 
feilds up!).  This area is designed with readability in mind, by not using confliting
colours, or different orientations of the data presented.  At the bottom of the status area
are the important enrol/unenrol buttons, and a clash resolution form button.  These buttons
were intended to be as large as the witdh of the right pane, so the user can see these 
buttons clearly.  The use of enabling/disabling buttons is intended to restrict the user
from unerolling enrolling in non existant tutes.
</P>
<P>When a user enrols/unenrols in an available timeslot, the status area changes
accordingly, to display the data for that tute. If enrolling the next button is also
activated to move to the confirmation window (vice versa for unenrolling).  This is intended
 to maintain a flow of control for the user. The clash resolution button is for students
who cannot enrol in an already full tute. A dialog box is brought up to inform the user
that a clash form will be sent to their email address if they want to (ie. it has options
in the dialog box).
</P>

<H3>The confirmation screen in the wizard...</H3>
<P>The confirmation is the final screen displays the users login and selected data from
the tutorial they selected in a similar way to the status area of the main screen
and utilises the same
reasoning behind them.  The purpose of this screen is to give the user a final clear
picture of what they are about to enrol in. In case the user wants to change their minds
they can click on back, or if they are happy, they can save and exit.

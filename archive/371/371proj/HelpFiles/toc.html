<H3>Welcome to the Enroller Help files.</H3>
<P> 
To run the demo go choose Files->Open and when the dialog opens choose from the available example files.</P>
<P>The current implementation loads the Enrolment class with
data from the file you choose and then initialises a wizard environment 
within an
EnrolmentFrame. After selecting a subject to view(there is only one subject)
, the main window of 
the wizard is brought up. The main window comprises of a simple grid layout
with pulldown boxes to select a tute on the left of the screen,and
a status area on the right with details about the selected tute
and buttons to enrol or unenrol from a tute, or to recieve a clash
resolution form. After a tutorial selection has been made,
 a final confirmation screen is brought up, with the final details of
the users selected tute.  The user can then save their enrolment in that tute.

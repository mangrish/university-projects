Project Specification

</DIV>

<P>
The object of this project is for you to gain some experience in
designing and implementing a graphical user interface (GUI).
The project is due at 12&nbsp;noon on Wednesday <B>18&nbsp;October</B>
and is worth <B>30%</B> of your mark for 371.

<P>

Background</A>
</H4>
You're all familiar with <TT>tutenrol</TT>, the program you've used
numerous times to enrol in tutes.  What we want you to do is
design a nicer GUI that provides essentially the same
functionality and implement it as an application in
JavaSwing.  We also want you to justify your design.

<P>
There's a skeleton implementation
(done by Tim Dwyer--thanks,
Tim) at:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><A HREF="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/371/proj/371proj.jar">http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/371/proj/371proj.jar</A></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE> also
available via <BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>/home/stude/data/371/proj/371proj.jar</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE> There's
also a <TT>README</TT> file in the same directory, which you should
look at.  You're to use this skeleton implementation as a
starting point for your own.  (A real enrol program would have
to contact some shared database.  The skeleton
implementation--and yours--accesses just a local XML file.
This is done for simplicity, and doesn't really affect the
user interface.)

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00000020000000000000">
Submission</A>
</H4> You should submit using <BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>submit 371 proj</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE> a
jar file called <TT>enrol.jar</TT>, including a <TT>Makefile</TT> with
default target to make your application and a target <TT>run</TT> to
run it.  Your submission should also include a justification of
your design, explaining your choice of layout and GUI
components.  This justification should be formatted in
appropriate HTML and be equivalent in length about 2 to 4
printed A4 pages.  You should create the HTML markup directly
with a text editor, <I>not</I> using a WYSIWYG HTML editor (we
want you to learn the HTML markup).  The justification should be
accessible via the help menu of your application.

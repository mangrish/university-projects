The following packages are used to implement the generic Enroller
program.  The program allows the user to add their name to a timeslot
in a timetable.  They can load the timetable file from an xml
datafile.  The user's name is specified on the command line when the
program is run, ie:

<p>
java -classpath .:jaxp.jar:parser.jar:$(JAVA_HOME)/lib/classes.zip 
		enroller/Enroller ${USER}

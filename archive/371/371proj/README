Building and Running the 371 Project Framework
==============================================

In the 371 www directory
(/local/dept/w3/subjects/current/371/proj) you'll find a
file called 371proj.jar or use the
http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/371 web page link to download it.
Copy this to somewhere on queeg or on your own machine if
you've installed the jdk1.3.  (If you possibly can I
STRONGLY recommend you install the jdk1.3 on your own
machine as it will be much faster).

On queeg you'll have to add /usr/java1.3/bin to your path and put
'ulimit -S -v 180000' to your .bash_profile.

If you're on a PC you'll also have to add the jdk1.3\bin dir to your
path... add it to the start of your path because otherwise an older
implementation of java will be picked up first.

Then do a:

jar xf 371proj.jar
cd 371proj

Then if you're on 'n'x:

make
make run

Or if you're on PC:

build
run

and remember to read the stuff under the help menu

Goodluck

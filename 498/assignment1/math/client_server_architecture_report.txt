SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
-------------------

The system architecture used is as appears in figure 1.  It is a basic
multithreaded client server architecture, with a client calling the server,
the server socket listener taking the request, and creating a new thread to
handle the client.

PROTOCOL
--------

The client server protocol is described in figure 2.  Basically, a 
client issues a request to the server using two String output streams
as defined by the system specifications handed out by the lecturer.
The Server is expecting a newline delimiter, so the client must implement
this to ensure compatibility. Likewise the Client expects the return string
to be delimited by a newline.  To ensure cross language support of byte
representations on a wire, the common Network Byte Order protocol is assumed.
